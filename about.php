            <p><strong>BESTLINK COLLEGE OF THE PHILIPPINES</strong> was founded in June 2002 as <i>“LOG-ON TODAY”</i> by the charitable and philanthropic Dr. Maria M. Vicente as President, and Engr. Reynaldo Corpuz as School Administrator
            It was initially located at Sacred Heart Village, Caloocan City. On the same year, the name “LOG-ON TODAY” was changed by management to BESTLINK INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (BIIT), inspired by the phrase, “Be trained to be the best; be linked to success”. Such name was deemed more appropriate since the school was offering TESDA-Accredited, computer-based courses, consisting of COMPUTER SYSTEM DESIGN AND PROGRAMMING (CSDP) COMPUTERIZED OFFICE MANAGEMENT (COM), COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORKING (CTN), and COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND WEB DEVELOPMENT (CGWD).

The school’s initial number of enrollees was seven (7) – five (5) in COMPUTERIZED OFFICE MANAGEMENT (COM) and two (2) in COMPUTER SYSTEM DESIGN AND PROGRAMMING (CSDP).

In 2004, the school transferred to its new location at #1044 Quirino Highway, Brgy. Sta.  Monica, Novaliches, Quezon City. Thereafter, another property nearby, located at #1071 Quirino Highway, Brgy. Kaligayahan, Novaliches, Quezon City was purchased by the school to address the needs of its fast-growing student population.

The growth of the school from technical to college level demanded a new name that will signify the change. Several suggestions were given by some school officials. The name BESTLINK COLLEGE OF THE PHILIPPINES as suggested by then Executive Vice President (EVP) Dr. Charlie I. Cariño, was finally agreed upon and unanimously approved. It was officially changed to BESTLINK COLLEGE OF THE PHILIPPINES (BCP) in 2012, following the accreditation and approval by CHED of several baccalaureate courses, such as BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (BSIT), BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN HOTEL AND RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT (BSHRM), BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (BSBA), BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN OFFICE ADMINISTRATION (BSOA), BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION (BSED), BACHELOR IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION (BEEd) AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN CRIMINOLOGY

(BSCrim), BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN PSYCHOLOGY (BSPsy), BACHELOR OF LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM (BLIS) AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING (BSCpE).

The continuing rapid growth of its enrollment prompted the school to scout for additional school site and it found one located at Topaz St. Corner, Sapphire St., Millionaire’s Village, Barangay San Agustin, Novaliches Quezon City, containing an area of one hectare. The school purchased it on February 17, 2012.

After the purchase of the above property, there was necessity of constructing a school building for its growing student population. This needed a building permit from the Department of the Building Official of Quezon City. For this purpose, consent of the Millionaire’s Homeowner’s Association, Barangay Clearance and Locational Clearance from the Department of the Building Official of Quezon City were compulsorily required.

Hoping for prompt action on the matter, the school enlisted the support of Mr. Tady Palma, Action Officer of the Novaliches District Center (NDC), Bishop Antonio Tobias and Mayor, Hon. Herbert Bautista.

In March 2012, a hearing was called by the Quezon City Council for the purpose of seeking justification from the school why it was qualified to be granted an exemption from the restriction on regulations on Medium Density Residential Zone,                                                                                                                                       aimed at converting the property from residential to commercial/educational area. The following school officials attended such hearing, namely: Dr. Maria M. Vicente, Dr. Charlie I. Cariño, Ms. Edith Vicente, Sr. Domnina S. Basquiñez, Assistant to the President and Atty. Lourdes T. Pagayatan, BCP Legal Counsel.

The School authorities were successful in convincing the Quezon City Council fort the above purpose. Thus, on February 25, 2013, it approved and passed a RESOLUTION granting BCP an exemption from the standing restriction, such that the MV property was converted from residential to commercial/educational area. After complying with all requirements, a Building Permit was issued by the Department of Building Official to the school on July 24, 2023. Construction followed in due course.

On January 10, 2013, the school acquired a property previously occupied by a school located at Minuyan, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. The existing building on the property as purchased was completely demolished on March 2013 because it was inadequate to serve the needs of BCP. Thus, a new school building was constructed thereon. The structure was thereafter occupied by the BESTLINK COLLEGE OF THE PHILIPPINES-BULACAN Branch (BCPB), inaugurated on August 7, 2013. Classes started to be held in the new building on August 12, 2013, with an initial enrolment of 841 students, all in TESDA-Accredited courses. Eventually, CHED program courses were offered, namely: BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN INFORMATION SYSTEM (BSIS), BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN ACCOUNTING TECHNOLOGY (BSACT), and BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN TOURISM MANAGEMENT (BSTM) AND BACHELOR OF TECHNICAL TEACHER EDUCATION (BTTE).

Commencing AY 2016-2017, the K-12 Curriculum took effect and the school decided to offer the Senior High School (SHS) Program both at the MV Campus and the Bulacan Branch, following accreditation and approval from the Department of Education (DepEd). Under such curriculum, Academic, Technical-Vocational, and Arts and Design Tracks were offered.  The Academic Tracks consisted of General Academic Strand (GAS), Accountancy and Business Management (ABM), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and Humanities and Social Science (HUMSS); Tech-Voc offered Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Home Economics (HE). Under Arts and Design is the Performing Arts (PA).

During the said initial Academic Year, Grade 11 enrollees at MV Campus was approximately 3,700 and 898 at its Bulacan Campus. The following Academic Year, the total enrolment of Grade 12 SHS reached 7,800 in its MV Campus and 2,607 in the Bulacan Branch. The school added another floor to its existing four (4) story building at the MV campus to accommodate the increasing number of SHS enrollees and to provide for them better facilities and bigger accommodation.

BCP commits itself in providing quality education to the youth especially to those belonging to marginalized families who cannot afford to send and sustain them in college. Having two (2) campuses in Quezon City, a branch in San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan, and continuing growth in student population BCP President Dr. Maria M. Vicente tapped the EJA VICENTE FOUNDATION INC., formerly TAWAG NG PANGINOON FOUNDATION, INC., which she founded. All BCP students are scholars of the said foundation, thus, they pay miscellaneous fees only, no tuition fee. Likewise, DepEd vouchers for SHS enrollees are maximized through the FREE sets of uniform, books/work texts, medical examination and other significant activities of the department.  

As of June 2018 the student population of the school stood at 23,422.

In 2023, three (3) more properties have been acquired by the school at the following locations: a San Agustin Campus located at 109 Susano Street, Barangay San Agustin Novaliches Quezon City;  b) Heavenly Drive, Susano Road, San Agustin Quezon City, where the existing structures are being utilized by the school for BS Criminology Students; c) #0006 Le Palm Street., Greenfields I, Barangay kaligayahan, Novaliches, Quezon City, this third one being intended as ANNEX of the BCP Main Campus.

The school has already allocated a budget for a SPORTS COMPLEX at its MV Campus, with seating capacity of a maximum of 15,000 people, with its ground floor to serve as parking area. Construction of this Sports Complex is expected to commence early part of 2024.

As of the first semester of AY 2023–2024, the student population of BCP stood at forty five thousand one hundred forty eight (45,148), a milestone for the school.
